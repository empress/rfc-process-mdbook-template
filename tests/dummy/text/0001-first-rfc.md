# Name of the RFC

Some introduction text, this is what we really think about your awesome RFC before we get into the details

## Overview

Let's start going into the details a bit more. And here is an example code block

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';

export default class Example extends Component {
}
```

oh did I say JS, I meant HBS:

```handlebars
{{this.something}}
<SomeComponent @foo={{2}} />
```

but let's be honest, we all want to see GJS/GTS:

```gjs
const Hello = <template>Hello, {{@name}}</template>;

<template>
  <Hello @name="world" /> ðŸ‘‹
</template>
```


or what does it look like with no language defined at all?

```
`ohNO` is an error that can be output but a command. If you get this error please inform us immediately
```

## Tables

Tables are great

| Key          | Value                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `table`      | `'super-awesome'`                          |
| more tables? | I can go for that!                         |
